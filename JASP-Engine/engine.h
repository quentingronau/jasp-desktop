/* The Engine represents the background processes.
 * It's job is pretty straight forward; it reads analysis
 * requests from shared memory (a semaphore is set when there
 * is a new message), and runs the analysis.
 * If an analysis is running when a new request is received,
 * and it is the same analysis (analysisId's match), then the
 * analysis is notified of the change (probably to one of its
 * options).
 * If the analysisId's don't match, then the old analysis is
 * aborted, and the new one is set running.
